# Password
Password Requirement - For - Smart Contract Execution -  Solidity 

This is a very basic example of a smart contract in Solidity that requires a password for execution.
For using something like this, remember, this is the blockchain, all is *public*

Good use cases for this is if you wanted to have a kill switch of sorts to a contract. One time input of a password to kill the contract/withdraw funds/etc...
